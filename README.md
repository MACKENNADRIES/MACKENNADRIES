- Hi, Iâ€™m @MACKENNADRIES
- ğŸ’­ Iâ€™m interested in back end and front end development, and gaining as much experience in these areas as I can! 
- ğŸŒ¿ Iâ€™m currently learning how to code! 
- ğŸ’˜ Iâ€™m loving coding in C# and python! 
- ğŸ’Œ My email is mackenna99@outlook.com, or my Linkedin is linked on my profile!
- âœ¨ Something different about me is that I am a goldsmith/silversmith and I like to tinker in my spare time!
